## Course Overview

<details><summary>Click to Read About the Course!</summary>
  
We will categorize coding interview problems into a set of 10 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques. These tools will enable you to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

Each problem not only maps to the same pattern but also presents different constraints. Overall, the course has around 125+ problems of varying difficulties. The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping into the problems. Under each pattern, the first problem will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems. The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.

## Assignments

<details><summary>Details</summary>
  
- For any assignment where we ask you to solve a problem(s) or conduct mock technical interviews in class, please work in a code editor of choice and submit your work to github periodically throughout the day with descriptive comments

- The `assignments` folder is where you find the assigned classwork & homework for each day. Assignments are broken down into 1 of 16 patterns, furthermore, you will find subfolders with the week and day designation (for example w1d1 stands for "week 1 day 1")

## Submitting Work

### Methodology

<details><summary>Details</summary>

1. Each of you should **fork and clone this repository**.
2. Make sure to pull from the central repository every day as files will updated periodically.
3. Enter the students folder in your fork and create a folder with your name in camelCase (eg *arielAvshalom*).
4. From this point on, follow this strategy for committing your work:
  
      A. Create a branch for a week (create one on our first day for the first 5 days) and call is week_# (eg (week_1*)
  
      B. For every day create a new issue labeled day_# (eg *day_1*)
  
      C. For each issue, make sure to commit often and periodically with helpful comments (eg *started problem #...* or *completed problem #...* or *attempted but could not solve problem #...* etc)
  
      D. Once you finish your work for the day, close the issue
  
      E. Once the week is complete, merge the branch to your repository and then make a pull request to the central repository.

### Important PSAs:

<details><summary>Details</summary>

- Always work in your own folder, not a classmates.
- Commit early and commit often
- Delete your branches after merging (make sure that you properly merged before doing this!)
- Avoid merge conflicts, think before you commit!
