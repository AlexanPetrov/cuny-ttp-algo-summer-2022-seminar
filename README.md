## Course Overview
We will categorize coding interview problems into a set of 10 patterns. Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques. These tools will enable you to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

Each problem not only maps to the same pattern but also presents different constraints. Overall, the course has around 125+ problems of varying difficulties. The problems solved under these patterns use a varied set of algorithmic techniques.

We will start with a brief introduction of each pattern before jumping into the problems. Under each pattern, the first problem will explain the underlying pattern in detail to build the concepts that can be applied to later problems. The later problems will focus on the different constraints each problem presents and how our algorithm needs to change to handle them.
